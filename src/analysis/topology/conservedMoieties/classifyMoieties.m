function [types, isSecondary] = classifyMoieties(L, S)
% Classifies conserved moieties for a metabolic network
%
% USAGE:
%
%    types = classifyMoieties(L, S)
%
% INPUTS:
%    L:        The `r` x `m` moiety matrix with moiety vectors as columns.
%    S:        The `m` x `n` total stoichiometric matrix.
%
% OUTPUT:
%    types:    an `r` x `1` cell array of with one of the following moiety classifications
%              'Internal' moiety that is also conserved in the open network
%              'Transitive' moiety that is only found in primary metabolites
%              'Integrative' moiety that is not conserved in the open
%               network and found in both primary and secondary metabolites.
%
%
% isSecondary  `m x 1` Boolean vector indicating secondary metabolites
%                      (containing at least one internal conserved moiety')
